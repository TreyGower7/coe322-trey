Title: Mars Meteortie Excavation Robot

Contents/Description:
Folder contains two python scripts, that work together. This project is important because it gives accurate times for a robot on mars to make a trip along the planets surface and excavate a meteorite. Given any set of data, even when not randomly generated, the script can calculate distance on a grid simulating mars surface.

Folder homework02 contains two python scripts. First, generate_sites.py, which generates a .json of your excavation sites on mars. And, calculate_trip.py, which calculates number of legs, travel time, and sample time.

Instructions to run:
First, use command {python3 generate_sites.py} to generate five random locations on mars surface. Then, use command {python3 calculate_trip.py} to calculate the number of legs, travel time, and sample time of the random meteorite locations on mars.
